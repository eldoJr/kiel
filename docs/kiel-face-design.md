# KIEL — 3D Interactive Wireframe Face (Design Concepts)

## 🔹 Base Concept

Not a "complete human face".
It's a geometric cognitive structure — half human, half neural network.

Think of:
- **head** = data topology
- **eyes** = sensors
- **lines** = processing flows
- **pulses** = neural activity

---

## 🎨 Main Visual Style

### ✅ Neural Wireframe Mesh

- Dynamic polygonal mesh
- Thin luminous lines
- Pulsing node points
- Higher density in "brain" region
- Lines reorganize when KIEL "thinks"

### Suggested Colors

- Emerald green neon (AI core)
- Electric cyan blue
- Cold white
- Neural purple
- Dark graphite background

---

## 👁️ Eye Ideas

The eyes are the identity point.

### Options:

**Eye Core**
- Two circular cores with concentric rings
- Slow rotation when idle
- Fast rotation when processing

**Scanner Eye**
- Horizontal line passing like a scanner
- Glow when detecting command

**Data Iris**
- Iris formed by hexagonal segments
- Segments light up according to activity

## ⚡ State Animations (very important)

The face changes according to KIEL's state:

### 🟢 Idle
- Slow light breathing
- Stable mesh
- Soft pulses

### 🟡 Listening
- Waves emanating from ears/eyes
- Lines vibrate slightly
- Highlight on sensors

### 🔵 Thinking
- Lines rearrange
- Nodes light up in sequence
- Animated circuit-like flow

### 🟣 Executing
- Fast pulses
- Traces running through mesh
- More intense glow

### 🔴 Warning/Error
- Partial fragmentation
- Slight glitch
- Red nodes

---

## 🧩 Interactivity

### Mouse / Touch Interaction
- Rotate head
- Zoom in/out
- Drag = distort neural mesh
- Hover = show "activity nodes"

### Voice Reactive
- Vibrates with voice volume
- Waves emanate from mouth/center
- Amplitude = sound intensity

---

## 🧬 Possible Face Shapes

### 🔹 Minimal Skull Frame
Just outline + eyes + central neural axis

### 🔹 Low Poly Head
Dynamic low-poly wireframe head

### 🔹 Neural Mask
Half face / half abstract neural network

### 🔹 Floating Core
No head — just floating "data mask"

## 🛠️ Ideal Technologies (web)

### Best Combo:
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- Drei helpers
- Framer Motion (UI sync)

### Specific Features:
- Shader glow lines
- Vertex displacement animation
- Audio-reactive shader
- Particle nodes
- Post-processing bloom

## 🧱 Component Structure (concept)

```
KielFace3D

```

## 🎯 KIEL Identity Touch

Add:
- Stylized **K** symbol in neural center
- Lines forming **K** when idle
- Exclusive geometric signature
- Unique pulse pattern (like "KIEL heartbeat")
